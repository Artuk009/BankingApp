# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The goal of this project was to develop an application that will allow the user to see how their investments will grow over time with different input variables. These variables included: the initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest(compunded), and the number of years the user will be investing for. The program returns two charts based on the input from the user: one that shows the year end balance and interest earned without monthly deposits and a chart that shows the same information but with monthly depsoits included in the calculations.

# What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well with implementing object oriented programing principals to make the main function as dry as possible. I also did well with utilitizing inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation in that the input values were stored in private variables that were inherited by the input and setter/getter functions and then called from a separate rate class file. I also made use of try/catch blocks to effectively validate user input for the main function so that it would throw an error code if the input was a negative integer.
